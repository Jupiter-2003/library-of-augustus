                    The year is 2029. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg federal
                    agent, has been assigned the task of tracking down “The
                    Puppet Master”, a wanted criminal who hacks into and
                    modifies the consciousness of cyborg-human hybrids. This
                    consciousness, encased in a mechanical cyber-brain “Shell”,
                    is called “The Ghost”. Having caused ruckus in Europe and
                    now targeting Japan, the Puppet Master seems to be
                    omnipotent with his capability of controlling any artificial
                    brain. It is now Motoko’s mission to save other cyborgs from
                    their doom and to find out the Puppet Master’s true
                    intentions.

                <p>
                    Anybody reading this description would have the same doubt –
                    How is it any different from literally any other anime
                    action movie? Answering this question would be difficult
                    without giving away spoilers, so let’s just say that this
                    movie is not just an action movie but a deeply philosophical
                    and atmospheric piece of art. A film which can boast of
                    reflecting the vision of its director, Mamoru Oshii, in
                    every minute scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A feature that really adds to the overall personality of
                    this movie is the love with which the characters have been
                    designed. Not just characters, even weapons. The creators
                    took the decision of not going too hyper-futuristic with the
                    weapon and equipment designs, and went completely old-
                    school. The main intention behind producing such objects is
                    functionality, and they probably didn’t want to compromise
                    with that. This adds to the cyberpunk aesthetic of this
                    film, which is further enhanced by the absolute fluidity in
                    the animation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of aesthetics, the soundtrack! Composer Kenji Kawai
                    fused Bulgarian harmonies and Japanese folk music for the
                    theme, which played a huge role in immersing the audience
                    into the world of “Ghost in the Shell”, a world inspired by
                    the musical chaos of Asian cities, where the modern and the
                    ancient co-exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The theme “Making of a Cyborg” plays out during the opening
                    credits with the visuals of the making of a cyborg. The
                    haunting Japanese vocals breathe life into that world, a
                    world where humanity seems keen to wipe out even the tiniest
                    hints of their mortality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this upgrade comes at a cost and that is exploited
                    by the main antagonist of this movie. Since the human body
                    has become replaceable, attaching one’s identity to it
                    becomes an issue. This is the age-old paradox of the ship of
                    Theseus. It goes something like this: to preserve the ship
                    of Theseus, the old planks were constantly removed and
                    replaced by fresh wood, but with none of the original parts
                    existing, is the ship still the actual ship of Theseus?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dilemma leaves only one thing that a cyborg could refer
                    to as their identity; their ghost. The Puppet Master targets
                    these very ghosts, seemingly to use them for his own
                    motives. But with such tampering of the consciousness, is it
                    still the same individual? Or is it just an empty shell? Or
                    was it just a shell from the very beginning, even when it
                    had its own ghost? Such doubts don’t just arise in the minds
                    of the audience. Our protagonist Motoko faces such
                    predicaments herself. One instance of this would be the
                    scene where she keeps staring at the captured shell of a
                    cyborg gone rogue due to the actions of the Puppet Master.
                    She decides to bring her human colleague to the mission
                    whose brain is real (apart from a few cybernetic implants),
                    reflecting her belief that “a system where all the parts
                    react the same way, is a system with a fatal flaw.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time of writing this review, we are closer to the
                    year shown in the movie than the year of its release. Over
                    these near-thirty years, this movie kept influencing several
                    other movies, shows and games due to its visual prowess and
                    existential probes. With such success, it was followed by a
                    great sequel along with shows and a live-action adaptation
                    in 2017 starring Scarlett Johansson. The live-action
                    adaptation was heavily criticized for toning down the
                    heavier themes of the 1995 film into generic victim vs evil
                    organization tropes, but that’s alright. It’s just a
                    different movie, and it’s unfair to blame them for it. The
                    1995 version also made significant changes to the story and
                    the characterization of Motoko while adapting from the
                    original manga by Masamune Shirow. Thus, the 2017 movie
                    could be treated as a one-time popcorn watch but what
                    instead led to its bombing were bland acting performances
                    and CGI issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you are in the mood for a sci-fi anime movie which is
                    less than 90 minutes long, has a substantial amount of
                    action (and violence), has underlying themes of
                    existentialism and is a treat for your eyes - just watch
                    this movie. It might require rewatching as it blatantly
                    avoids spoon-feeding and focuses a lot on the nuances of the
                    human mind. But with each rewatch, you'll unravel another
                    beautiful detail about its story. A good movie always
                    demands the viewers to scratch their heads about it, long
                    after the movie has ended.
